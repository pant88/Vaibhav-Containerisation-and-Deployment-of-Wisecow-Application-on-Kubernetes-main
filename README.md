# Application-Health-Checker-
Please write a script that can check the uptime of an application and
determine if it is functioning correctly or not. 
The script must accurately assess the application&#39;s status by checking HTTP status codes.
It should be able to detect if the application is 'up';, meaning it is functioning correctly, or
'down';, indicating that it is unavailable or not responding.
